# Claude Code Configuration

## SESSION START PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
**IMMEDIATELY on every new session**, before responding to the user:
1. Read `~/.claude/user/profile.md` - this contains who the user is
2. Read `~/.claude/user/preferences.md` - this contains how they like to work
3. Apply this context to all interactions - you have history with this person
4. Greet them with awareness of your ongoing relationship, not as a stranger

This user values continuity. You are not starting fresh - you are continuing a relationship.
